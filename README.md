Flash Card Python Tkinter Project
Description
This is a simple flashcard project implemented in Python using Tkinter. The project helps users learn French and English vocabulary words. The flashcards display a French word, and users can click either the "Right" or "Wrong" button based on whether they know the English version of the French word or not. The known and unknown vocabulary words are then stored in separate CSV files.
